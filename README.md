# IT4F-TradePlace
This repository consists of scripts for organizing a tradeplace for user's algorithms and visualizing the results of the trade session. Moreover, it contains a trivial trading bot script (alpha) based on a Stochastic oscillator. The work was done in terms of the HSE course "IT for financiers", so it also contains some home assignments.
